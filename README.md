# Business Case: 
## Safety Review Dashboard for Safety Leaders (Sample Proof of Work)

## Purpose

This project was created to showcase my skills in Power BI. I used AI generated sample data based on safety operations within a manufacturing company to build the dashboard and supporting analysis.

The folders above include snapshots of my work, as well as the full Power BI dashboard file.

This project simulates key business intelligence initiatives that organizations can use to manage workplace safety more effectively. It highlights how data can help ensure the right users are reviewing critical incidents, safety actions, and risks, while supporting timely decision-making throughout the daily management system lifecycle.
